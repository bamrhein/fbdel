In 2013 I wanted to delete my Facebook history without deleting my profile, mostly because the interface they provide only lets you delete one thing at a time, and that irked me. So I wrote this super hacky one-off script that you could paste into your browser's JS console. They change their interface so often that this surely doesn't work anymore. But with some element inspection and minor tweaks, I think this could be modified to work in TYOOL 2018.

This was also around when I was learning more frontend stuff. In particular I was learning about "Immediately Invoked Function Expressions" and prototypes vs "objects". You know, the fun parts of this wacky language!
